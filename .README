## Challenge: Discover the Wonderland of Graph Networks

This test was given by a brazilian company for a job interview.

Welcome to your adventure! In this challenge, you'll dive into a graph derived from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."

### The Graph Dataset
In this graph, nodes represent characters, and edges represent interactions. A connection between two characters means that they interacted in some manner throughout the book.

### Your Quest

Your mission is to explore this graph and uncover intriguing insights. How you do it is up to you. We value creativity and initiative, so take the lead and show us what you can discover.

### How You'll Be Evaluated

1. **Creativity**: Bring your unique perspective and innovative ideas to the analysis.
2. **Relevance**: Ensure your findings are meaningful and insightful.
3. **Clarity**: Present your analysis and results in a clear and coherent manner.
4. **Question Formulation**: Demonstrate your ability to ask pertinent questions and find answers.
5. **Independence**: Show your resourcefulness and ability to independently find and apply information.
6. **Functionality**: Ensure your notebook runs smoothly from start to finish.
7. **Explanation**: Clearly explain your thought process, methods, and conclusions.

### Tips

- Use `pandas` to load and explore the dataset.
- Utilize `networkx` or any other equivalent library to handle the graph.
- Conduct additional research on graph analysis techniques, such as centrality measures, community detection, connected components, network visualization.
- Dive into the documentation of the libraries you use.
- Spend some quality time formulating interesting questions to uncover insights based on your analysis.
- Reserve a moment to properly document your code, process and findings.
